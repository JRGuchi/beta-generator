This is purely programming practice and not meant to be useful. Do not use any of these insights as inputs into investment decisions, as you will certainly lose money.

Scrapes, API pulls, and data analyses currently intended as signals for crypto investment but will likely bleed into public equities.

Practice with Messari and perhaps some other crypto-related APIs.

I will also be scraping the following websites for insights into growth and product/market fit at some point:
- Github
- Twitter
- Discord
- Reddit
- TBD on what else
